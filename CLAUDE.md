# NBA Season Record Projection System

## What this project is

Projects each NBA team's regular-season record for an upcoming season as a
**probability distribution** (not a single number), built bottom-up from the current
roster's players. Compares those projections against betting and prediction-market
prices (Kalshi, Polymarket, historical sportsbook win totals) to find places where an
analytically-driven model disagrees with the market.

**This is a research tool for identifying market disagreements. The user is not
betting.** The deliverable is *explainable per-team disagreement* — "we differ from
the market on this team, and here is the structural reason why."

Current projection target: **2026-27 season**.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for full architecture, statistical traps, and staged plan.

## Communication preferences (IMPORTANT)

**Always expand statistical acronyms on first use in any response, with a one-line
plain-English description.** The user has not taken a statistics class recently and
has explicitly asked for this. Do not assume familiarity with standard notation.

Examples of the expected style:
- MAE (mean absolute error — the average miss, ignoring whether it's high or low)
- RMSE (root mean squared error — like MAE but punishes big misses harder)
- SD (standard deviation — the typical distance from the average)
- R² (r-squared — the share of variation the model explains, 0 to 1)

This applies to output printed by scripts too, not just chat responses. Reports
should carry their own legend.

## Decisions made (and why)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Player impact metric | **Compute our own** from nba_api | Guarantees full 21-season point-in-time coverage, no licensing constraints, we control era normalization. Full RAPM-from-play-by-play kept as documented upgrade path. |
| Fit / coaching modules | **Strict backtest gate, but report findings either way** | Keeps the production projection trustworthy; still answers the user's curiosity. A module that fails its gate gets dropped from the projection and written up as a finding. |
| Timing scope | **Preseason projection only** | Matches how win-total markets are priced; keeps backtest protocol clean. No in-season updating. |
| Modeling target | **Win percentage**, not wins | Three seasons in the window are not 82 games. Wins are a presentation-layer conversion. |
| Franchise join key | **`TEAM_ID`** | Stable across relocations and renames (Seattle→OKC, New Jersey→Brooklyn, Bobcats→Hornets). Never join on name or abbreviation. |
| Market data role | **Strictly downstream, never a feature** | If market prices touch training, the disagreement analysis becomes circular and meaningless. |

## Architecture

```
A. Player talent projection   (impact per 100 possessions, aging, shrinkage)
B. Minutes & availability     (240 min/game budget, injuries, replacement level)
C. Team aggregation           (minute-weighted sum -> off/def rating)
D. Monte Carlo season sim     (real schedule, home court, rest -> win distribution)
E. Market comparison          (downstream only)
```

**Why bottom-up:** 21 seasons x 30 teams = **630 team-seasons**. That is far too few
rows to fit a team-level model with the many features originally envisioned (positional
balance, pace, coaching, turnover type, fit). All heavy lifting therefore happens at the
**player level** (~10,600 player-seasons), and layer C stays nearly parameter-free.
Minute-weighted sums of player impact predict team rating well enough to make this work.

**On "fit":** it is *not* a feature set to add. Player impact metrics already contain
rebounding, turnovers, and shooting — re-adding them double-counts. Fit is modeled as
the **residual that additive aggregation fails to explain**, reduced to ~5-8
diminishing/increasing-returns parameters (see DESIGN.md §3). That is a size 630 rows
can actually support.

## Measured results so far

Walk-forward means: to predict season N, train only on seasons before N. All errors in
82-game-equivalent wins, lower is better.

| Baseline | MAE | RMSE |
|---|---|---|
| Market (preseason win total), excl. 2019-20 | **6.67** | 8.53 |
| Market, all seasons | 6.70 | 8.57 |
| Mean-reverted previous wins ← *the naive bar* | 8.07 | 10.01 |
| Previous wins (persistence) | 8.75 | 11.19 |
| Always .500 | 10.18 | 12.30 |
| *Theoretical binomial noise floor* | *3.44* | *4.31* |

Fitted mean-reversion coefficient **k ≈ 0.62**, stable across folds (0.610–0.649):
teams retain about 62% of their distance from .500 year over year.

Implied true-talent spread is **SD ≈ 11.6 wins** vs **4.3 wins** of luck, so talent
variation dwarfs randomness and projection is worth doing.

### ⚠️ How to read the noise floor honestly

The 3.44 MAE binomial floor is **not an achievable target**. It assumes we know each
team's true strength in October *and* that strength stays constant all season. Real
rosters change through unforeseeable injuries and trades, so the practically achievable
frontier is considerably higher — and the market's 6.67 is probably close to it.

Do **not** present "market captures only 30% of the gap to the floor" as an opportunity
estimate. Realistic aggregate improvement over the market is on the order of a few
tenths to ~1 win of MAE, and may be zero. The genuine value of this project is
per-team disagreement attribution, not beating the market on average.

## Data inventory (all availability windows empirically verified)

Stored in `data/` (gitignored; regenerate with `python scripts/fetch_all.py`).

| Dataset | Rows | Seasons | Span |
|---|---|---|---|
| `player_advanced` | 10,595 | 21 | 2005-06 → 2025-26 |
| `player_base` (per-100) | 10,595 | 21 | 2005-06 → 2025-26 |
| `team_advanced` | 630 | 21 | 2005-06 → 2025-26 |
| `game_log` (team-games) | 50,538 | 21 | 2005-06 → 2025-26 |
| `rim_defense` (tracking) | 6,823 | 13 | 2013-14 → 2025-26 |
| `hustle` | 5,455 | 10 | 2016-17 → 2025-26 |
| preseason win totals | 630 | 21 | 2005-06 → 2025-26 |

**Availability cliffs that constrain the fit work:** tracking data starts 2013-14 and
hustle data 2016-17. So "fit" features exist for only 10-13 seasons (300-390
team-seasons), roughly half the backbone's coverage.

### Source notes

- **nba_api** (stats.nba.com) — primary. Rate-limited; every call goes through
  `nbaproj/cache.py` (disk cache + throttle + exponential backoff). Re-runs are free.
- **Basketball-Reference** — preseason win totals only, from
  `/leagues/NBA_<end_year>_preseason_odds.html`. `/leagues/` **is allowed** by their
  robots.txt; `*/gamelog/`, `*/splits/`, `*/on-off/`, `*/lineups/`, `*/shooting/` and
  `/basketball/` are **disallowed** and must not be scraped — get that data from
  nba_api instead. Honor `Crawl-delay: 3`. Requires a browser User-Agent.
- **Kalshi** — `api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2`, reads fine unauthenticated.
- **Polymarket** — `gamma-api.polymarket.com`, reads fine unauthenticated.
  Both are too recent for historical baselines; they are for the *live* 2026-27
  comparison only.
- **Pro Sports Transactions** (historical injuries) — returns 403 without a normal
  User-Agent. Best historical injury-reason source; fallback is deriving games-missed
  from box-score absences via nba_api (ToS-clean but loses injury *reason*).

### Season-length landmines (handled, do not regress)

- 2011-12 = 66 games (lockout); **win totals were set for 66 games** (league avg 33.1)
- 2020-21 = 72 games; **totals set for 72 games** (league avg 36.0)
- 2019-20 = 64–75 games, varying **by team** (only 22 of 30 went to the bubble);
  **totals were set for a full 82** because the interruption came later. This makes its
  market comparison apples-to-oranges — reported separately, never silently mixed in.
- 2012-13 = 81 games for BOS and IND (game cancelled after the Boston Marathon bombing)

## Layout

```
nbaproj/
  cache.py       throttled, retrying, disk-cached nba_api wrapper
  ingest.py      per-dataset pulls; availability windows as constants
  teams.py       team-season target table; franchise spine
  baselines.py   walk-forward naive baselines + noise floor
  odds.py        preseason win totals scraper + strict franchise join
scripts/
  fetch_all.py       full historical pull (idempotent, resumable)
  baseline_report.py Stage 1 report: the bar
```

## Conventions

- Walk-forward backtesting throughout. Any coefficient is refit **per fold** using only
  prior seasons. Never fit on the full history and report it as out-of-sample.
- **Point-in-time correctness:** features for season N may use only information
  available before season N started. This is the easiest way to fake a good backtest.
- Normalize per-100-possessions and z-score **within season** — the league changed
  enormously across the window (pace ~90 → ~100 possessions, three-point attempts
  ~16 → ~38 per game).
- Every new stage must beat mean-reverted previous wins on walk-forward MAE, or it does
  not ship. Report the comparison explicitly.
- Fail loudly on data joins. `odds.py` raises if any season fails to match all 30
  teams; prefer that to a silent partial join.

## Roadmap

- ✅ **Stage 0** — Data layer: cached, throttled, point-in-time-correct pulls, 21 seasons
- ✅ **Stage 1** — Baselines: naive + market + noise floor. **Bar = 8.07 MAE naive,
  6.67 MAE market**
- 🟡 **Stage 2** — Player impact metric **built**; aging curves + shrinkage still to do.
  Offense calibrates well (r-squared 0.88); defense does not (0.45) and its player-level
  values are close to a restatement of rebounding (corr 0.89), i.e. it partly measures
  *being a centre* rather than defending. Aggregates acceptably at team level
  (net-rating r-squared 0.84) because every team plays centres ~48 min/game.
  **Known defect:** aggregation slope is 7.7 where algebra predicts 5, because
  sub-threshold players get no estimate — replacement level in Stage 3 is the fix.
- ⬜ **Stage 3** — Minutes & availability model (injury history, 240-min budget,
  replacement level)
- ⬜ **Stage 4** — Additive team aggregation → off/def rating
- ⬜ **Stage 5** — Monte Carlo season simulation → calibrated win distributions
- ⬜ **Stage 6** — Fit as residual structure (diminishing returns). *Gate may reject.*
- ⬜ **Stage 7** — Coaching / roster continuity as shrunk effects. *Gate may reject.*
- ⬜ **Stage 8** — Live Kalshi/Polymarket comparison + contract-year hypothesis test

### Decisions pending user input

- ⬜ **Defense estimation.** Box-score defense is positionally biased and cannot be
  fixed by adding more box features. The real fix is RAPM (regularized adjusted
  plus/minus) from play-by-play: ~25,000 games to pull and cache, plus ridge
  regression on stint-level data. Roughly an overnight data pull. Worth it only if
  defensive *personnel* questions matter to the user beyond aggregate team projection.

### Open items

- ⬜ Historical **injury reasons** still unsourced (Pro Sports Transactions needs a UA;
  otherwise only games-missed is available)
- ⬜ 2026-27 preseason win totals not yet published on bbref (404 as of July 2026) —
  live market comparison will need Kalshi/Polymarket
- ⬜ Contract/salary history unsourced (only needed for the contract-year test)
- ⬜ Roster definition for backtest: plan is to reconstruct opening-night rosters from
  each season's first games. Using full-season rosters would understate real-world
  error, since February's roster is unknown in October.

## Hypotheses to test (not assumed)

- **Contract-year / post-extension effects.** Popularly believed, poor replication
  record. Major confound: players get paid *after* a career-best season, so apparent
  post-contract decline is substantially regression to the mean. Test explicitly;
  do not assume into the model.
- **Peak age.** Folk wisdom says 28-30; evidence points to ~26-27 for overall impact,
  with three-point shooting holding later (~29-31) and rim finishing / defensive
  mobility declining earlier. Model aging **per skill**, not as one curve.
- **Health history × age interaction.** Plausible that injury history is more damaging
  for older players. Recent games-missed likely carries more signal than career total.
- **Coaching.** Only ~10-30 team-seasons per coach and heavily confounded with roster
  quality. Roster continuity is better documented and far easier to measure — try it
  first.
